## Hello, I'm Tom ðŸ‘‹

This is a collection of my coding projects which is continually expanding!

The highlights, currently, are my MERN stack veterinary clinic web application [_Pawfect Care_](https://github.com/tthecoder15/T3A2-MERN-App/tree/main/T3A2-B), my CLI application [_Pokemon Card Guessing Game_](https://github.com/tthecoder15/Pokemon-Card-Guessing-Game-CLI-Application) which was built using Python (and you can easily install and play today!) and my [portfolio website](https://github.com/tthecoder15/Portfolio-Website) which was built using static HTML and CSS.

Currently I am working on a trading card search engine to further enhance my state management and query handling knowledge.

Enjoy!
